Lecture 36 - The Dom

DOM: Document Object Model

The DOM is a structured representation of an HTML Document

The DOM is used to connect webpages to scripts like JavaScript
- You can say that each HTML element could be represented by a block between HTML tag

For each object (HTML BLOCK) there is an object in the DOM that we can access and interact with.

JAVASCRIPT and the DOM are 2 different things.
Up to this point we've just been using the Javascript language with NO interaction with the webpage.
Now we're going to use special JavScript methods that allow us to interact with and manipulate the DOM (web page)
- Methods are functions attached to objects. Those objects are the DOCUMENT objects

HTML web page content is stored in the DOM. We're going to use JavaScript to manipulate it now!

Lecture 37: HTML and CSS basics

Elements of HTML are:
- opening tag
- content
- closing tag

We use CSS to write rules to style our webpage.
- We can use IDs or other selectors, but class is the most frequent one used

Events: Notifications that are sent to notify the code that something happened on the webpage;
  Examples: clicking a button, resizing a window, scrolling or pressing a key
Event Listener: A function that performs an action based on a certain event. It waits for a specific event to happen.

Execution Stack:
An event can only be executed or handled once the execution stack is emptied and returned

After Global Execution context is loaded THEN event listeners are loaded so they are ready to do what they need to do by adding their individual event handling code to the execution stack.
